Instructions:

1) Install the newest JDK from Oracle. https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
2) Choose the Code button -> download ZIP.
3) Extract the Zip to a folder you want.
4) Double-click "run.bat" or "HugoHiihto.jar". The game should start up if you have a correct JDK. The file "run.bat" has the command "java -jar HugoHiihto.jar". The Operating System might warn you of executing unknown exe and bat files.

On Linux, you might have to make the JAR file executable first: https://askubuntu.com/questions/270172/how-can-i-make-a-jar-file-executable
The game was tested with Windows 11, Linux and MacOS.

## Linux
requirements: maven 3+ and java 17+

mvn package
java -jar target/hugoskifx-1.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

Version 1.1 (2024) - English texts, Finnish voice acting, 
Java skiing game - Hugo the Troll fan game, 
I do not own the Hugo franchise - support the official releases!


Recommended Java Development Kit version: 23 or newer. The folders "lib" and "src" are important.

"ITE Media" / "5th Planet Games" owns the original Hugo series. Thank the original creators for the Hugo franchise! Some graphics, musics and videos have been copied from the original Hugo series. 
I own nothing of the original resources. I own the Java files I programmed. They are open-source and can be edited by anyone. 
New in v1.1, for example: 
- Commodore 64 music by Jens-Christian Huus
- Old phone sounds with 4 and 6
- English texts
- A cheat code with 12 numbers
- Smaller files, a bit more animation etc.

Google Drive has the JDK (for Windows x64, 64bit) and also the original MP4 cutscenes available: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/110sPxB1HPm08zQFlkPZfCN3-ZpUfN7zv 

No matter what GitHub informs you, this is made 100-percent with the Java programming language. "Shell" and "Html" come from the "Java Media Framework" library that has been used.

If a video cutscene does not start, please move the mouse cursor on the window. The visuals depend on your own computer. The speed of the graphic objects might be extremely slow or fast, depending on the computer.
